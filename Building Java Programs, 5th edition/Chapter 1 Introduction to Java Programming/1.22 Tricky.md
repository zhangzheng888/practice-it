What is the output produced from the following program? You may wish to draw a structure diagram first.

```
public class Tricky {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        message1();
        message2();
        System.out.println("Done with main.");
    }
â€‹
    public static void message1() {
        System.out.println("This is message1.");
    }
}
```
